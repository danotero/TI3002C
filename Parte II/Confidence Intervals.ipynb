    "# Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a statistical range or interval used to estimate the true value of a population parameter, such as a population mean or proportion, based on a sample of data. It provides a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this range of values is equal to a **point estimate** plus/minus a **margin of error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{point estimate}\\pm\\text{marginf of error}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point Estimate:** The point estimate is a single value computed from the sample data that is used as an estimate of the population parameter. For example, if you are estimating the population mean, the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is often used as the point estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin of Error:** The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty or variability associated with the point estimate. It quantifies how much the point estimate is likely to vary from the true population parameter. It is typically expressed as a positive value and is based on the variability in the sample data and the chosen **level of confidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level of Confidence:** The level of confidence represents the probability that the confidence interval contains the true population parameter. It is expressed as a percentage and is often set at common levels such as 90%, 95%, or 99%. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if the same sampling and analysis process were repeated many times, about 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for constructing a confidence interval depends on the type of parameter being estimated (mean, proportion, variance, etc.) and the underlying probability distribution of the data. Common methods for constructing confidence intervals include the use of t-distributions for means, normal-distributions for proportions, and chi-squared distributions for variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are widely used in inferential statistics to make statements about population parameters based on sample data. They provide a measure of the precision and reliability of an estimate, allowing researchers and analysts to communicate the uncertainty associated with their findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you expect, we are going to compute some confidence intervals using `Python`, so let us load some relevant libraries."
